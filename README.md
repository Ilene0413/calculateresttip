**Calculate Restaurant Bill Tip Amount** The app will calculate the tip for a restaurant bill based on the bill amount entered before tax and the percent tip a customer wants to leave.

The app is created using node.js.

The user is required to enter the bill amount prior to tax, percent tip they want to leave, and the number of ways to split the tip.
